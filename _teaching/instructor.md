I was an instructor for the Precalculus course designed for first-year undergraduate students. This course covered basic algebra, system of linear equations, the study of polynomial functions with graphing of polynomial functions, and an overview of conics. This served as a prerequisite for courses predominantly for Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science Majors.
