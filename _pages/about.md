I am a PhD candidate at Ahmedabad University, India, working under the supervision of [Dr. Alok Shukla](https://ahduni.edu.in/academics/schools-centres/school-of-arts-and-sciences/faculty/alok-shukla/). My area of research includes quantum computing and its applications to scientific computation. Previously, I have worked on digital image processing using quantum computation. This included denoising circular banding noises from digital grayscale images. The research article can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42484-024-00205-9). 

Currently, I am studying quantum algorithms to numerically obtain a solution to differential equations with an additional constraint of the differential equation preserving Lie symmetries.
