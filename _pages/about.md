I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at Ahmedabad University, India. My area of research includes quantum computing and its applications to solve differential equations numerically. 

Previously, I have worked on digital image processing using quantum computation. This included denoising of circular banding noises from digital grayscale images. The research article can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42484-024-00205-9)
